# My Mini MagicMirror for Desktop ðŸ“†

## Overview
I wanted a compact and functional way to keep track of my **to-do lists**, **calendar events**, and other daily tasks right on my desktop. Using a Raspberry Pi, I built a **Mini MagicMirror** that does exactly that. This project combines my love for tinkering with technology and my need to stay organized.

## Hardware I Used
- **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B**
- **7" Screen**
- **HDMI Cables**
- **16GB MicroSD Card**

## Software Setup

### 1. Installing Raspberry Pi OS
First, I downloaded and installed the Raspberry Pi OS (Full version) onto my 16GB MicroSD card using the Raspberry Pi Imager tool.

### 2. Setting Up MagicMirrorÂ²
I followed the [official MagicMirror installation guide](https://docs.magicmirror.builders/getting-started/installation.html#manual-installation). Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process I used:

1. **Installing Node.js**  
   I made sure to download and install a compatible version of Node.js for my Raspberry Pi. You can find versions for:
   - [Linux Distributions](https://nodejs.org)
   - [Other Platforms](https://nodejs.org)

2. **Checking for Git**  
   I checked if Git was already installed by running:
   ```
   git
   ```
   If it wasnâ€™t installed, I ran:
   ```
   sudo apt install git
   ```

3. **Cloning the MagicMirror Repository**  
   Next, I cloned the MagicMirror repository with:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror
   ```

4. **Navigating to the Repository**  
   I navigated into the cloned repository folder:
   ```
   cd MagicMirror
   ```

5. **Installing MagicMirror**  
   To install everything MagicMirror needed, I ran:
   ```
   npm run install-mm
   ```

   > **Note:** This step took a while (about 10 minutes on my RPi3), so I grabbed a coffee and let it finish.

6. **Configuring MagicMirror**  
   I copied the sample configuration file to set up my MagicMirror:
   ```
   cp config/config.js.sample config/config.js
   ```

7. **Starting MagicMirror**  
   Finally, I started the MagicMirror application with:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

   Alternatively, for **Server Only** mode, I could have used:
   ```
   npm run server
   ```

## Next Steps
Now that Iâ€™ve got the MagicMirror up and running, Iâ€™m customizing it with modules to make it truly mine. Some features Iâ€™m planning to add include:
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Syncing my events and reminders.
- **To-Do List**: Using the `MMM-Todoist` module to keep track of tasks.
- **Weather Updates**: Adding a weather module for daily forecasts.

This setup is already making my workspace more productive and organized. If youâ€™re interested in building something similar, feel free to ask questions or share your ideas!
